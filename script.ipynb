    "# TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS \n",
    "\n",
    "## OVERVIEW \n",
    "Transportation systems are the backbone of modern economies, facilitating the movement of goods, services, and people across cities, states, and nations. They play a vital role in commerce, tourism, and daily living, directly impacting economic productivity and societal well-being. However, as transportation networks grow in complexity, they face challenges such as safety concerns, inefficiencies, sustainability issues, and environmental impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Project\n",
    "This project focuses on leveraging data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), a key branch of the U.S. Department of Transportation. BTS provides comprehensive and reliable data on passenger travel, freight movement, safety incidents, infrastructure capacity, and environmental impacts across multiple transportation modes, including road, rail, air, and water.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst at getINNOtized, with BTS as the organizationâ€™s largest client, you are tasked with analyzing this rich dataset to uncover patterns, identify inefficiencies, and propose actionable recommendations. By doing so, the goal is to help BTS address challenges such as safety, congestion, infrastructure stress, and economic disruptions, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of transportation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "1. Analyze transportation data to identify inefficiencies, uncover patterns, and recommend improvements for safety,sustainability, and operational efficiency.\n",
    "2. Identify patterns and inefficiencies within transportation systems.\n",
    "3. Develop actionable recommendations to improve safety, sustainability, and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical Questions:\n",
    "1. What are the trends in passenger travel across different transportation modes over time?\n",
    "2. Which transportation modes experience the highest safety incidents, and what are the contributing factors?\n",
    "3. How does congestion vary across regions, and what are its main causes?\n",
    "4. What is the environmental impact of different transportation modes (e.g., emissions, energy consumption)?\n",
    "5. Which routes or modes are the most cost-effective for freight movement?\n",
    "6. How does infrastructure capacity utilization differ across modes and regions?\n",
    "7. What are the patterns in peak travel times, and how can they be optimized?"
